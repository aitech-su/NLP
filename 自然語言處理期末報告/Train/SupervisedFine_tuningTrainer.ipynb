We consider\\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\\\sim\\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \\\"ordinary\\\" shock, at which the\\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically.

In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. We also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT equations of motion has been discussed.\",\n          \"We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite background in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear Schr{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlinearity. We apply the inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and dark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of the multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.\",\n          \"We present a critical review about the study of linear perturbations of matched spacetimes including gauge problems.
